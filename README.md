# Fight-For-Freedom
Sci-Fi Text Based RPG
This a project I am currently working on that will tell a simple story. You will be able to play as your own character, choose from different dialogue options,
which will lead to different endings. Too many games label themselves as a role-playing game without letting you immerse yourself within a role.
I wanted to create something that allowed for character freedom. You don't have to be the good guy. You don't have to be the bad guy. 
You can just be a guy, fighting aliens, trying to win back your freedom.

This is a project made exclusively with Java. As of now, there will be no GUI components, howevever I did my best to follow the MVC architecture for 
that to be a simple transition later on.
